# Breast_Cancer_Predictor

The information presented in this file contains data representing the correlation between characteristics or features of cells in Malignant and Benign masses. Some of the features include "uniformity of cell shape" and "clump thickness".
After plotting the data in pairplots and heatmaps to visualize our values, the data was then split into a training and testing group using sklearn and preprocessing methods. 
The data was then fit into various ML algorithms/classifiers to test the models accuracy. The results of each test were displayed in a confusion matrix and visualizers. 
########
These operations were performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook with the only requirement being the imported librariesand the breast cancer data set which is also available on kaggle.
